### Data Science Projects

[Linear Regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ameyer73/ameyer73.github.io/blob/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/02-Linear%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

In this project I analyzed fake customer data from an ecommerce company and used linear regression to help them decide whether to focus their efforts on their website or their mobile app.  I used Python's Seaborn and Pandas packages to visualize the data and scikit-learn to create the linear regression.

[Logistic Regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ameyer73/ameyer73.github.io/blob/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/02-Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

This project is an analysis of some fake advertising data, and I used logistic regression to help predict whether or not a particular internet user will click on an ad based on that user's features.  I used Seaborn and Pandas to visualize the data and scikit-learn to create the logistic regression.

[K Nearest Neighbors](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ameyer73/ameyer73.github.io/blob/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/02-K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project%20Final.ipynb)

In this project I use K Nearest Neighbors to analyse a fake data set with unknown feature names in order to predict a class for a new data point.  I used Seaborn and Pandas to visualize the data and scikit-learn to create the machine learning algorithm.

[Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ameyer73/ameyer73.github.io/blob/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/02-Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project%20Mine%20%281%29.ipynb)

This project is an analysis of publicly available data from LendingClub.com.  I used lending data from 2007-2010 to try to classify and predict whether a borrower would pay back their loan in full.  I used Seaborn and Pandas to visualize the data and scikit-learn to create the deicions tree.
